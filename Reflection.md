# CarND-PID-Control-Project
## Reflections

I've implemented a simple PID controller in C++.

* P Component : it compensates the actual error
* I Component : it compensates the long term error
* D Component : it compensates the overshooting

It is able to drive a car around the track in the Udacity simulator.
A video of my final Solution is available on Youtube.

At the beginning I've used the parameters from the lessons before:

* Kp: 0.2
* Ki: 0.004
* Kd: 3
